Introduction
------------

This workshop applies theories and methods learned in [4.510](/courses/4-510-digital-design-fabrication-fall-2008) (rapid prototyping and mostly CAD CAM level machinery) to larger scale projects. The purpose of the course is to serve as an intermediate step towards the use of fabrication tools in studio and practice. The emphasis of the course is on process and application to solve real world design and fabrication problems.

The environment is half that of a studio where larger design visions are broken into biweekly assignments using advanced modeling tools and fabrication devices. The emphasis is on design learning through in-depth studies along the four phases of professional design (schematic design, design programming, design development, and construction documentation). Advanced learning is done through hands-on tutorials, field trips and a working environment that combines research with design studio interaction.

Projects range from small furniture design to a large scale single space. The course does not explore projects beyond 200 square feet. Course structure is composed of two studies using advance modeling software and NC devices in order to learn process.
